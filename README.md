## Agenda

1. If you don’t have one yet: [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) – it’s free.
2. Find a team mate.  
   Working together in teams works great to get to know fellow attendees, learn
   from each other and help the mentors to be available to everyone.
3. [Add yourself as participant](add_yourself_as_participant.md)
4. [Find an issue](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) to work on with your team
5. Enjoy :)

## Open Source projects and issues for new contributors

- [Hoodie Camp](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues) – look for the `up for grabs` label.
- [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/labels/beginner-friendly) - beginner-friendly issues

You can also search for issues across all repositories. Good labels to look for are
[first-timers-only](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afirst-timers-only),
[good-first-pr](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-pr)
and [help wanted](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
You can also search by programming languages by adding `language:python` for example
(see [searching issues](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) for all available options).

Maintainers: please add links to contributor-friendly issues above :)
